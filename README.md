# Weather App

This project is a web-based weather application that allows users to enter a location and retrieve the current weather conditions for that location. The app displays details such as temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the current weather.

## Features

- **User Input**: A text input field where users can enter the name of a city or location for which they want to check the weather.
- **Submit Button**: A "Submit" button that triggers the weather data retrieval.
- **Display Weather Data**: After a user submits a location, the app displays the current weather conditions for that location, including temperature (in Celsius), weather description (e.g., "Sunny," "Cloudy," "Rainy"), and an icon representing the current weather condition.
- **Styling**: The app is styled with CSS to be visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly.
- **Error Handling**: The app provides appropriate error messages if the user enters an invalid location or if there are issues with the API request.
